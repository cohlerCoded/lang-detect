# lang-detect

A language detection app made in Node.js

How it works:

In the CLI, make sure you're in the lang-detect directory and type: node index.js 'your text here'
Using process.argv as well as the franc, langs, and colors Node packages, the app will make a guess as what language the text you enter in the quotes is. 

Enjoy!!!
